#### AccessPoint Inc. (<http://www.accesspointinc.com/>)

A story submitted by Bret Gregory: "I work for AccessPoint Inc., a
privately-held CLEC offering integrated communications services to small-
and medium-sized businesses. We use Cayenne for our internal accounting and
reconciliation application. This application allows us to recognize
uncaptured revenue streams as well as accounting margins and billing
errors. In addition, Cayenne is used in our internal reporting application.
These applications and thus Cayenne are central to the financial health of
the company."

GLIN is a legal repository for the Law Library of Congress. It has been
around for 30 years, and in digital form since the early 90s. However, it
was only partially publicly available before February 2005 when a
Cayenne-based system was launched. The system has roughly 200,000 records,
spanning 200 gb of fulltext data and 15 gb of associated metadata. It
represents the world's largest publicly available legal index, spanning 10
languages and 35 jurisdictions. The system is accessible in 4 languages
currently and will support 14 languages in the nearest future, thus
becoming the most internationalized site in the federal government, after
the IRS.
