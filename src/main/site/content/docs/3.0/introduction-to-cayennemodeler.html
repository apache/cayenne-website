It provides a comprehensive set of O/R functions, including:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Work with Cayenne mapping projects.</LI>
	<LI>Reverse-engineering RDBMS schema into Cayenne DataMaps.</LI>
	<LI>Generation of the database schema from the mapping information stored in DataMaps.</LI>
	<LI>Java class generation from the mapping information stored in DataMaps.</LI>
	<LI>Management of the project deployment structure and database connection information.</LI>
