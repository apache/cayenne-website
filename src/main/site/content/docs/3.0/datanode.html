	<P>DataNode is a Cayenne &quot;driver&quot; for a single physical data source, such as a relational database. In fact currently DataNode only handles JDBC sources (so maybe it should be renamed to JdbcDataNode?). </P>

<P>DataNode doesn't do much work on its own, instead delegating most tasks to <TT>&quot;org.apache.cayenne.action.SQLAction&quot;</TT> instances returned by <A href="dbadapter.html" title="DbAdapter">DbAdapter</A>.</P>
