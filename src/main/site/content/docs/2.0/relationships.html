<P>Relationships are special DataObject properties that reference other &quot;related&quot; objects. Semantically there are two types of relationships - to-one pointing to just a single DataObjects (e.g. Painting.toArtist), and to-many pointing to a collection of DataObjects of the same base type (e.g. Artist.paintingArray).</P>

<H3><A name="Relationships-ToOneRelationships"></A>To-One Relationships</H3>

<P>&quot;Get&quot; methods for to-one relationships return the target DataObject. If the object is not in memory yet, it will be fetched on demand. Modifying to-one relationships is no different from modifying attributes - just a simple call to a &quot;set&quot; method:</P>

<H3><A name="Relationships-ToManyRelationships"></A>To-Many Relationships</H3>

<P>&quot;Get&quot; methods for to-many relationships return Lists of DataObjects. Just like individual DataObjects, such lists are also resolved on demand (e.g. when a user tries to read an element from the list). For modification there are special &quot;addTo...&quot; and &quot;removeFrom...&quot; methods:</P>
