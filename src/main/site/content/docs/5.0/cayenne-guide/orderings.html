 <div class="paragraph">
  <p>An Ordering object defines how a list of objects should be ordered. Orderings are essentially path expressions combined with a sorting strategy. Creating an Ordering:</p>
 </div>
 <div class="listingblock">
  <div class="content">
   <pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java java" data-lang="java">Ordering o = new Ordering(Painting.NAME_PROPERTY, SortOrder.ASCENDING);</code></pre>
  </div>
 </div>
 <div class="paragraph">
  <p>Like expressions, orderings are translated into SQL as parts of queries (and the sorting occurs in the database). Also like expressions, orderings can be used in memory, naturally - to sort objects:</p>
 </div>
 <div class="listingblock">
  <div class="content">
   <pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java java" data-lang="java">Ordering o = new Ordering(Painting.NAME_PROPERTY, SortOrder.ASCENDING_INSENSITIVE);
List&lt;Painting&gt; list = ...
o.orderList(list);</code></pre>
  </div>
 </div>
 <div class="paragraph">
  <p>Note that unlike filtering with Expressions, ordering is performed in-place. This list object is reordered and no new list is created.</p>
