<P>Many-to-many relationships can be modeled in two different ways:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>By modeling a join table as an ObjEntity. This is the most trivial case but it makes traversing many-to-many relationships relatively inconvenient.</LI>
	<LI>Making join table transparent to the object model. This is achieved by using flattened relationships discussed further in this chapter.</LI>
